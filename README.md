# GeminiRAG-app
The app uses vector_stores to locally store the context for the RAG app.
To improve or optimize the performance of the app play around with : chunk size, chunk overlap and the prompt template.

## NOTE---->>>>
For deployment purposes use a vectorDB service like : Pinecone vectorDB or chromaDB to allow storing of context documents on the cloud.
